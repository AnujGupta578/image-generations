what exactly is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the practice of using on-demand computing resources as services hosted over the internet.
“Over the internet” is what makes up the cloud part.
It eliminates the need for organizations to find, set up, or manage resources themselves.
And they only pay for what they use.


Cloud computing uses a network to connect users to a cloud platform.
This is a virtual space where they can access and borrow computing services.
A primary computer handles all communication between devices and servers to share information.
And there are privacy and security measures to keep everything safe

the cloud enables organizations to access computing resources on-demand, without spending time and money buying and maintaining their own storage, hardware, and software.

It’s the unique infrastructure of a cloud computing model that makes all of this possible.
This infrastructure has four main components: hardware, storage, network, and virtualization.


hardware 

Types of hardware include servers, processors, and memory; network switches, routers, and cables; firewalls and load balancers; cooling systems; and power supplies.

Now, data storage in a cloud computing infrastructure can occur in three main ways: file, object, or block.

File storage keeps data in one place and organizes it in a simple, easy-to-understand way through a hierarchy of files in folders.

This is the oldest and most widely used data storage system, but it’s a bit cumbersome and can only accomplish so much.

object storage holds unstructured data, along with its metadata.

Metadata is just data about data.
For example, a picture taken with a smartphone might contain information about the location, the date, and the type of device that captured the image.

This is really useful for understanding the photo, just as metadata explains what its own data is all about.

Lastly, block storage divides large volumes of data into smaller pieces, optimally organized, with unique labels.

An advantage of block storage is that the data is easily accessible, but it can be expensive and has limited capability to handle metadata.

 network.

 After all, cloud computing infrastructure needs a way to connect to its backend resources, and this connection is made possible through a network of the physical hardware.

 Through this network, users tap into cloud resources using some of the hardware mentioned earlier, including routers and firewalls.


 the physical network setup is what enables the virtual one to operate.

 there is virtualization, which is technology that creates a virtual version of physical infrastructure, like servers, storage, and networks.
This is what lets the service work without a connection.


data centers.

A data center is a physical building that contains servers, computer systems, and associated components.
These facilities provide a centralized location for vast amounts of data.
And skilled cloud analysts access this valuable information right through the cloud!

For all sorts of business tasks and projects, cloud analysts select and extract relevant data, then prepare it for processing and examination.

They know how to expertly analyze, visualize, and share data discoveries to uncover valuable insights and make smart business decisions.

it’s really important to know that there are three primary models to choose from.

Each offers a different level of flexibility and control.


These models are infrastructure as a service, or IaaS; platform as a service, PaaS; and software as a service, SaaS.


First, IaaS is a cloud computing module that offers on-demand access to Information Technology, or IT infrastructure services, including hardware, storage, network, and virtualization tools.

With IaaS, a service provider hosts, maintains, and updates the infrastructure.

Your organization would manage everything else: your operating system, your data, and your applications.

An IaaS model provides the highest level of control over your IT resources and works a lot like traditional on-premises IT.
An example of an IaaS model is cloud storage, like emails you’ve sorted into an online folder.

A user picks the infrastructure they want, uses it for the contracted period, but they do not own it.


Next, PaaS provides hardware and software tools to create an environment for the development of cloud applications, simplifying the application-development process.

PaaS is all about helping users build apps.

So, your organization would enjoy being able to fully focus on app development without the burden of managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

Your developers would create, test, troubleshoot, launch, host, and maintain your app all on the platform.

PaaS is like hopping into a taxi and telling the driver where to take you.

Lastly, SaaS provides users with a licensed subscription to a complete software package.

This includes the infrastructure, maintenance and updates, and the application itself.
Other users also have access to use the same services.

Using SaaS, you’d just connect to the app through the internet.


Remember that these examples are meant to demonstrate the level of individual customization in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.


accessibility.
One of the big advantages of a cloud computing model is that organizations can access and


manage data, software, storage, and cloud infrastructure from any location at any time through the internet.

They don’t need to be physically present where the hardware and software are installed.
00:45
And they don’t need their cloud service provider’s assistance when they need more data.
00:50
Next is scalability, which means to easily expand or upgrade computing resources to meet changing needs.

Scalability eliminates physical computing limitations.

Now, the benefit of cost savings is pretty straightforward.
01:05
Organizations only pay for the computing resources used.

In a cloud computing model, organizations get what’s called a measured service.

Similar to household utilities like electricity and water, users are charged only for what they
01:19
use, based on the number of transactions, the storage volume, and the amount of data transferred.
01:25
This helps make all kinds of business initiatives more profitable and sustainable.

The advantage of security is also pretty straightforward.

With cloud computing, an organization’s systems, data, and computing resources are protected from theft, damage, loss, and unauthorized use.


Cloud computing security is generally recognized as stronger than the security of a traditional network infrastructure.



This is because data is located in data centers that few people have access to.

Plus, the information stored on cloud servers is encrypted, meaning it’s not something that’s easily broken into.


efficiency.

There’s a lot that’s efficient about cloud computing, but one of the main advantages is that organizations can provide immediate access to new and upgraded applications.

There’s no time wasted worrying about the state of network infrastructure or going through a costly or time-consuming implementation process.


freeing resources

so users can focus on more value-added tasks.

In the cloud field, we refer to this as managed services.
02:38
A managed service involves a third-party provider taking care of the ongoing maintenance, management, and support of an organization’s cloud infrastructure and applications.
This, in turn, gives users lots more time to focus on other work.
It’s like a mechanic who automatically comes to you for annual inspections and services, rather than you spending many hours in a mechanic shop waiting for services.
That's because all of the ongoing maintenance and management from the cloud happens automatically in the background; a user doesn’t have to initiate it.

Because cloud computing is super versatile, it offers a wide range of common uses including disaster recovery, data storage, and large-scale data analysis that provides users with significant benefits.


disaster recovery.

Using cloud computing in disaster recovery means having access to more data centers to ensure that data and information is safe and secure during an emergency.

data storage.

Data storage helps streamline data centers by storing large volumes of data, which enables easier access to the data, analysis of the data, and backup of the data.

we have large-scale data analysis.
Large-scale analysis offers easy and quick access to multiple data sources, and intuitive user interfaces to query and explore the data.
This speeds up the overall process of discovering data-driven insights.

Traditional computing is a computing model that enables data storage, access, and management through the use of physical hardware and software within a network infrastructure, typically located on-premises.

First, hardware is set up in a dedicated space or room by IT professionals.

Next, the required software —operating systems, applications, and security tools— are purchased and installed.
Once the hardware and software are operational, IT personnel are responsible for maintaining and managing the entire system.
This infrastructure gives an organization sole control and access to its data and equipment.
So, with traditional computing, everything you need is located in one location, on-premises, and can’t be accessed anywhere else.

This defining characteristic offers four key advantages: control, security, compliance, and no reliance on the internet.

First, with traditional computing, organizations have full control over their hardware, software, and data.

They can customize their localized network infrastructure to meet their specific needs.

And because of this control, users usually feel more confident about the second advantage —security— if properly maintained.

This is because they have sole access to their systems and sensitive information.

Third, traditional computing might be the only viable option if a business is in an industry that requires data to be stored on-premises.

This is an example of compliance, which means that a company must follow certain regulations, rules, and laws.

In this case, ones that deal with data security.

Lastly, traditional computing does not rely on an internet connection when users want to access the network or the data it contains.

so, important information can be accessed even if internet service goes down
But just as with our photo album example, there are some downsides.

First, with a traditional computing system, data access is limited to the device and location where the hardware and software are installed.

Also, scaling up in a traditional computing model is challenging.

Software limitations, the time needed to purchase and set up hardware, and the physical space required make it difficult to scale and expensive.

Besides scaling up expenses, traditional computing involves buying hardware and software, plus ongoing maintenance of network infrastructure.

Lastly, traditional computing can be inefficient, as each user’s software must be purchased, rather than shared.

And, again, the software is not automatically updated.

These are just some of the reasons why many organizations are moving to the cloud for their computing needs.
The cloud is more accessible, scalable, and offers tons of savings.

It’s also super-secure, efficient, and frees up staff to work on more projects.
It’s picture-perfect!


The fact is, traditional databases struggled to keep up with the evolving demands of data analytics.

Luckily, cloud data warehouses are emerging to fill the need.


How do they do it?

First, a cloud data warehouse is a large-scale, data storage solution hosted on remote servers by a cloud service provider.

To understand this better, picture it like a huge warehouse where large amounts of different types of containers from various places are stored.

The cloud data warehouse can collect, store, integrate, and analyze data.

There are many advantages to this structure.
Cloud data warehouses are typically fully managed by the cloud provider.
This means that the cloud provider takes care of various operational tasks and maintenance, allowing

users to focus on utilizing the data and gathering insights rather than handling the underlying infrastructure.

This saves time, money, and resources.

Cloud data warehouses also have more uptime compared to on-premises data warehouses.

Uptime is the amount of time a machine is operational.

And, of course, only working computers have the ability to scale and support increased demands for data.

Next, cloud warehouses can integrate separated data by gathering data from various structured sources within

an organization, like sales systems, email lists, and websites, and pulling it all into one place.

This integrated data then can be analyzed for some pretty exciting and useful business insights.

Another big advantage is that cloud data warehouses provide real-time analytics, ensuring users have quick access to the latest information.

And in business, being fast is usually the key to outperforming the competition.

Cloud data warehouses also offer some really cool artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, or ML, capabilities.

And when you apply AI and ML to your data analysis, this really powers up the possibilities.

My team worked on a recent project where we built a predictive model to help Google

anticipate demand for office amenities, such as its cafés, and help save money and reduce waste.

Using ML tools, we were able to test over 30 factors across months and months of data and

build a model that could forecast demand with enough accuracy and time to allow on-the-ground teams to adjust accordingly.

Pretty cool, right?

Last but not least, cloud data warehouses enable custom reporting and analysis.
This means that users can analyze and generate reports specifically from historical data because it

is stored on a separate server from data related to current business transactions and day-to-day operations.

As you've probably figured out, the types and amounts of data that companies need to organize are only growing, which means so is the demand for data storage.


Luckily, cloud data warehouses are up for the challenge with the added benefits of management and analysis to make it even easier to use the data you have.
