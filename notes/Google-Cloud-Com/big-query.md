Okay, data enthusiasts, now that we know what cloud-based data warehouses are, we should probably figure out which one suits our needs.

Meet BigQuery: Google's powerhouse of storage and analysis.

And data warehousing helps make the most of that data by providing quick and easy access to information, which leads to ideas, insights, and, best of all, data-driven decision-making.

BigQuery is a data warehouse on Google Cloud that helps users store and analyze data right within BigQuery.

They can query data, filter large datasets, aggregate results, and perform some really complex operations.

BigQuery works with SQL, or structured query language.

This is a computer programming language used to communicate with the database.

It allows users to search through massive amounts of data —and find information they are searching for— incredibly quickly using Google infrastructure.

As a cloud data analyst, BigQuery's integrated SQL interface and machine learning capabilities will help you discover, implement, and manage data tools to inform critical business decisions.

The output of your work in BigQuery can integrate with typical business intelligence tools or spreadsheets.

Another feature is BigQuery’s ability to easily migrate existing data warehouses from other cloud service providers.

One of my favorite things about BigQuery is its dry-run parameter.

This lets you check your query thought process and plan before actually running it.

And BigQuery will tell you the number of bytes the query will run so you can estimate the cost before actually querying the database.

It’s like a practice swing in golf to help you make sure your ball goes in the hole!

You can also use BigQuery to store, explore, and run queries on data gathered from servers, sensors, and other devices.

And scheduled queries can be used to automatically refresh data and keep tables up to date.

Data can be updated hourly, daily, or weekly, so you’ll deliver the most dynamic, timely metrics to your stakeholders.

On my team, we use BigQuery almost daily to query, transform, and report on data.

Using BigQuery, we're able to tap into a multitude of data sources, which allow us to support our users with the most relevant insights.

We use SQL to join datasets and transform the data, creating tables and charts that provide answers.

And when we land on an answer that can be useful in the future, we scale it, building self-service

reports and dashboards that allow users to retrieve the same answer over and over again in a timely manner.

For my team, BigQuery helps us create a bridge between the data that exists and the problems folks are trying to solve or questions they're trying to answer.

With its smooth integration with other tools, user-friendly interface, and the use of SQL for effective programming, BigQuery makes the discovery of valuable information within complex datasets simple and productive.

It’s an essential part of the cloud data analyst’s toolbox.
