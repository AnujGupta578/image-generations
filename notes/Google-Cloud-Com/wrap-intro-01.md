It’s been a blast introducing you to the field of cloud data analytics!
You’ve learned that cloud computing is an advanced and powerful computing model that resolves many limitations of traditional computing.
It also addresses evolving data computing needs of people and businesses all across the globe.
Cloud computing provides on-demand availability of computing resources as services over the internet, which offers accessibility, scalability, cost-savings, security, and efficiency.
And it frees up your time and resources so you and your colleagues can focus on the kinds of tasks that bring more value to your team and organization.
You began this course with an introduction to cloud computing.
You then learned about its history, current defining characteristics, and the advantages of using a cloud computing model.
Next, you examined the differences between cloud computing and traditional computing, like a physical network infrastructure in traditional computing versus a cloud network infrastructure in cloud computing.
You've got this.
And remember to celebrate your hard work in a favorite way: a yummy snack, a comfort show, or a touchdown celebration.
