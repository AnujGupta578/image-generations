Image Generation model families

# Variational autoencoders (VAEs):

Encode images to a compressed size, then docode them back to the original size while learning the distribution of the data

# Generative adversarial models (GANs): 
Pit two neutral networks against each other.

# Autoregressive models: 
Generate images by treating an image as a sequence of pixels


# Diffusion model: 
New trend of generative model


## Unconditioned generation

1. Human face synthesis
2. Super resolution 


## Conditional generation

1. Text to image

"Mona lisa wuth cat face"

2. Image inpainting

"Remove the woman from the image"

3. Text-guided image to image

"Disco dance with colorful lights"


Recent advancements

Many improvements have been made alreday: 

1. Faster generation
2. Conditional models
3. CLIP

Text to image ,pdels combine the power of diffusion models with LLMs

# MCQ
1. Which process involves a model learning to remove noise from images?
Ans:  Reverse diffusion

2. What are some challenges of diffusion models?

Ans:  All of the above

They can be difficult to control.
They can be computationally expensive to train.
They can generate images that are not realistic.

3. What is the process of forward diffusion?


Ans:  Start with a clean image and add noise iteratively

4. What is the goal of diffusion models?

To learn the latent structure of a dataset by modeling the way in which data points diffuse through the latent space

5. What is the name of the model family that draws inspiration from physics and thermodynamics?

Diffusion models
